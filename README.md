# The Metric

Web application for The Metric

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/8e48634c-3066-49a4-a099-b27251163d3f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/metric/deploys)

---

### System Architecture

- The webiste is hosted and collaborated on in [GitHub](https://github.com/cacabo/metric)
- Content is posted, tagged with topics, and managed in Ghost
- The Ghost instance is hosted on [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/)
  - It can be accessed at [ghost.themetric.org](https://www.ghost.themetric.org)
- The [themetric.org](https://www.themetric.org) domain is registered and configured on [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com)
- The website sources content from Ghost and is built as a static website
- The website is hosted on Netlify, it deploys automatically with each new commit to the master branch

---

### Website Architecture

- Gatsby is a library for building static websites with React
- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript for adding static types to variables
- ESLint is a library for enforcing style and formatting rules
- Prettier is a library for automatically reformatting code, it works hand and hand with ESLint under our configuration
- styled-components is a library for writting CSS-in-JS

### Getting Started

Clone this repository to your machine. Navigate to the cloned directory in your terminal and run `yarn` to install all dependencies.

Configure your environment to have a `GHOST_API_KEY` for sourcing content from Ghost. For linux users, this can be done via an `env.sh` file of the form:

```text
export GHOST_API_KEY="..."
```

Next, source the environment. For the `env.sh` file, this can be done by running `source env.sh`.

To run the website locally, run `yarn dev` and navigate to `localhost:8000` in your browser.

To build a production build, which serves as a good indicator of if a deploy to Netlify will work as expected, run `yarn build`.

---

### Debugging

If there are issues with stale content, components, or otherwise odd occurrences, try running `yarn clean` and re-running the website locally. This deletes the cache of assets and components which Gatsby produces for performance reasons.
